    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Guacamole is an avocado-based dip or spread that originated in<br> 
        Mexico. It's typically made with mashed avocado and lime juice,<br> 
        then seasoned with salt and cilantro. Guacamole often contains<br> 
        tomatoes and onions.</p>
    <p>It couldn't be easier to make restaurant-worthy guac at home:<br> 
        Simply mix all the ingredients together! That's it. You'll find<br> 
        the step-by-step recipe below.</p>
    <p>Serve this guacamole with tortilla chips, crackers, or fresh<br> 
        vegetables for dipping. You can also spread it on toast, use it<br> 
        as a hamburger or sandwich topping, or dollop it onto a baked<br>
        potato.</p>
    <p>Avocados have a tendency to turn brown when they're exposed to air,<br> 
        so guacamole loses its brightness rather quickly. You can prevent<br> 
        this by placing the guacamole in an airtight container, then covering<br> 
        the top with a thin layer of water, lemon juice, or lime juice.<br> 
        This barrier will keep the air from getting in. Seal the container<br> 
        and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days.</p>
