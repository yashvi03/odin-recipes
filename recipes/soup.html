    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Blend roasted broccoli, cream cheese, and vegetable broth to<br>
        make a simple, yet delicious soup. Roasting broccoli enhances<br>
        its flavor, allowing nutty and sweet flavors to develop.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups chopped broccoli florets and stalks</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>Â¾ teaspoon lemon pepper, or more as needed</li>
        <li>crushed red pepper flakes to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking<br>
            sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place broccoli, onion, garlic, and olive oil in a large bowl and toss<br>
            to coat evenly. Place on the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Roast vegetables until soft, 30 to 35 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes.<br>
            Remove from oven. Chop 1/4 cup of broccoli florets; set aside for garnish.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining vegetables with vegetable broth, cream cheese, and lemon<br>
            pepper in a high-powered blender or food processor in batches. Puree soup<br>
            until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour soup into a saucepan over medium-low heat until warmed through, about<br>
            5 minutes. Season with additional lemon pepper to taste. Ladle into bowls.<br>
            Garnish with reserved chopped broccoli and crushed red pepper.</li>
    </ol>
